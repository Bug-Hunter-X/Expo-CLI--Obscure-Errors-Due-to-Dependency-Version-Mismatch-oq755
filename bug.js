This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has a package.json file containing a dependency that is not compatible with the version of React Native being used. This incompatibility can manifest in various ways, such as unexpected behavior, runtime errors, or build failures.  For example, a dependency might have code that relies on a newer version of a React Native API that is not available in the current project setup.  The error messages themselves can be quite vague, offering little specific guidance on the root cause. This is because the underlying issue is an incompatibility between package versions rather than a problem within a specific piece of code.
